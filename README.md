# whatsapp_clone

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started


I spearheaded the development of a cutting-edge messaging application utilizing Flutter for the frontend, Node.js for the chat server, and Socket.io for real-time communication. This WhatsApp clone not only replicates the familiar user interface and experience but also introduces enhanced functionalities. 

Users can seamlessly exchange text messages, multimedia files, and capture and share photos. The application supports group creation, media file sharing, and dynamic status updates, offering a comprehensive messaging experience. My role involved designing and implementing the frontend UI using Flutter, setting up a robust chat server with Node.js, and integrating real-time communication through Socket.io. 

This project not only showcases my proficiency in mobile app development but also demonstrates my ability to create a feature-rich, user-friendly application reminiscent of WhatsApp.

This ongoing project not only highlights my proficiency in mobile app development but also showcases my commitment to delivering a comprehensive and feature-rich messaging experience, UI part almost ready and the chat server part is under developing condition but we will achieve soon.
